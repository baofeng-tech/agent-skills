# OpenClaw Twitter OAuth

**OAuth-based X/Twitter posting for autonomous agents. Powered by AIsa.**

One API key. Simple authorization. Direct posting.

## What Can You Do?

### Publish Posts
```text
Help me post this to Twitter: Today we released a new version.
```

### Return Authorization Links When Needed
```text
Post this to X, and if authorization is needed, give me the approval link.
```

### Continue After Approval
```text
I already authorized Twitter. Post this update now.
```

## Quick Start

```bash
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Python Client

```bash
# Show current client configuration
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py status

# Request an authorization link
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py authorize

# Request an authorization link and open it in the browser
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py authorize --open-browser

# Publish a post
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py post --text "Hello from Twitter OAuth"

# Publish a reply only when the user explicitly asks to reply
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py post --text "Hello from Twitter OAuth" --type reply

```

## Core Behavior

This skill is designed around the user intent of posting to X/Twitter.

Recommended flow:

1. Try to publish the requested content first.
2. If posting fails because access has not been authorized yet, return an authorization link.
3. After the user completes authorization, publish using the authorized account.

## Commands

### `status`

Show the current local client configuration.

### `authorize`

Request an authorization link for the current user context.

### `post`
Publish a post.

#### Character Limit & Thread Splitting Rules:
1. Maximum 280 characters per tweet (Chinese/full-width characters/Emojis count as 1 character each);
2. If content exceeds 280 characters:
   - The Python client automatically splits content into chunks before publishing;
3. If any chunk fails to post, the multi-chunk publishing process stops and returns an error.

## Agent Instructions

When the user asks to publish content to X/Twitter:

1. Check whether `AISA_API_KEY` is configured.
2. Try `post` first when the user intent is to publish content.
3. Default to `--type quote` for publishing. Only pass `--type reply` when the user explicitly says they want to reply.
4. In this skill, `reply` only controls the `type` argument passed to the Python client. It does not require asking the user for a target tweet URL or tweet ID.
5. If the user says things like `use reply mode to post: ...`, `使用reply方式发送推文：...`, or `reply发这条：...`, run the `post` command directly with `--type reply`.
6. Do not ask follow-up questions about which tweet to reply to unless the user explicitly asks to target a specific tweet.
7. If posting indicates that authorization is required, run `authorize` and return the approval link.
8. Do not claim the post succeeded until the publish step actually succeeds.

## Guardrails

- Do not ask the user for their Twitter password.
- Do not use cookie-based login or proxy-based login unless the user explicitly asks for legacy behavior.
- Do not claim authorization succeeded just because an authorization URL was generated.
- Do not ask for a tweet link or tweet ID just because the user requested `reply`; use `--type reply` directly.
