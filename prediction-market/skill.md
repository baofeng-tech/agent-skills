Understanding Odds
Prices are shown as decimals (0.65 = 65% probability)
"Yes" price = probability market thinks event will happen
Higher volume = more confidence/liquidity
Prices change based on trading activity

Use Cases
Market Research: Track prediction market sentiment
Trading Analysis: Analyze historical prices and orderbooks
Portfolio Tracking: Monitor positions and P&L
Arbitrage: Find price differences across platforms
Forecasting: Use market prices as probability estimates

Error Handling
400 - search requires status parameter (open or closed) — always include both
401 - Invalid API key
429 - Rate limit — wait and retry
Empty markets array means no markets match the search term
Activity endpoint returns recent trades globally — no filters required
Tips
Check multiple markets for the same event
Volume indicates market confidence
Recent activity shows sentiment shifts
Polymarket focuses on politics/world events, Kalshi on finance/weather
